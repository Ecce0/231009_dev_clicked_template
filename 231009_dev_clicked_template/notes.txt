Flows should be used for a smaller company. Never mix triggers and flows.
Flows are limited to what can be done in the org and sometimes, you'll arrive
at a point where you have to use apex coding. So in most instances, use triggers. 

Never put methods for a specific object, within another trigger that's intended
for the same object. For example, methodA() and methodB() both target the Account
object, but they're in two different triggers that target the Account object.
Basically, put all methods within one trigger for one object.

When you want your user to see something update immediately, in real time, use a 
trigger. If you don't want your user to see updates (i.e. application for a job 
would require a HR to review the resume before the candidate moves to the interview
stage, so you don't update them immediately whether they move to the interview stage),
then put it in an async process.
